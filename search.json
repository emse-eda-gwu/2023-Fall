Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using Quarto (which is built on the ideas of RMarkdown). Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\n\n\n\nStudents should have taken EMSE 4571/6571: Intro to Programming for Analytics or have experience working with data in at least one programming language. If you’re not sure whether you have the necessary prerequisite skills, you can try and get up to speed by completing this optional course primer assignment before class starts. Once class starts, it may be difficult to keep up without this background, and it may be more beneficial to wait and take this course next year after taking Programming for Analytics."

Hadley Wickham (chief data scientist at RStudio and author of many amazing R packages you’ll be using) made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions in Slack, and try it again later.\nI promise, you can do this!"

Make up quizzes will not be available if you miss it (except for excused absences). Please show up on time to class each week to ensure that you do not miss a quiz. Quizzes will cover material presented in previous classes and assignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz.\nQuizzes are short (10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to demonstrate where additional study is needed. Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."

If you do AI tools on assignments in this class, you must include the prompt(s) you used as well as changed to made to them to get better results to receive full credit. I want to see how you are using them. Be transparent - that is all I ask.\nFor writing assistance, LLMs are again permitted, but again I want to see how you used them. If you used an LLM to help you with any of the writing portions of your assignments, include a section called “Use of AI on this assignment” and describe which tool(s) we used and how they were used.\nYour goal in using tools like ChatGPT should be to see them as an assistant - a tool to help you accomplish the task - rather than as a solutions manual.

Even if you work together on an assignment, write your own code.\nProviding code you have written for an assignment to anyone else in the class.\nPutting code solutions from the course assignments online.\nReceiving code-level assistance from any person not associated with the course.\nGetting someone else to write the assignment code for you.\nAsking questions about the assignments on any online services outside of the course office hours / Slack.\n\nCheating on quizzes, assignments, or the final project can include:\n\nReferring to any external resources while completing the assignment (phones, notes, etc.).\nCopying part of an answer off of another student’s paper, even if it is very small.\nUsing solutions provided by students who previously took the course.\n\n\nPenalties\nViolations will be reported to the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities. Penalties are decided by the course instructors, and can vary based on the severity of the offense. Possible penalties include:\n\nReceiving a 0 on the assignment/quiz in question.\nReceiving a full letter grade deduction in the course.\nAutomatically failing the course.\n\nDepending on the student’s prior academic history, violations may also be accompanied by a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs, again at the instructors’ discretion. This can lead to university-level penalties, such as being suspended or expelled.\n\n\nGrace Period\nCollege is a time when you do a lot of learning. Sometimes, you might make bad decisions or mistakes. The most important thing for you to do is to learn from your mistakes, to constantly grow, and become a better person.\nSometimes, students panic and copy code right before the deadline, then regret what they did afterwards. Therefore, you may rescind any homework submission for up to 24 hours after the deadline with no questions asked. Simply email the course instructors asking to delete the submission in question, and we will do so. Deleted submissions will not be considered during plagiarism detection, though of course they will also not be graded. However, it will always be better to get a 0 (or partial credit) on an assignment than to get a cheating violation!"

    "text": "The world is full of data, but sometimes finding it can be difficult. As a starting point, GW libraries has an excellent set of Research Guides that can be helpful. Depending on your research question, searching Google can also lead to good sources.\nHere are some other resources:\n\nLarge, search-able sites\nBasically like running a Google search but only for data sets:\n\nGoogle Dataset Search\nQuandl: Over 2 million financial, economic, and social datasets.\nWharton Research Data Services: Single-point access to over 200 terabytes of data across multiple disciplines, including Finance, Marketing, and Economics.\n\n\n\nWebsites\nA collection of various websites that have lots of interesting datasets:\n\n“Tidy Tuesday” challenges: Wide variety of datasets for data visualization practice. See many of the visualizations others have created here.\n“Makeover Monday” challenges: Wide variety of datasets for data visualization practice.\nTableau Community Forums: Sometimes you’ll find some interesting datasets in here.\n“Data is Beautiful” subreddit: Feed of user-generated data visualizations, though quality varies substantially.\nKaggle: Hosts machine learning competitions, and as a result has lots of really interesting data sets open to the public.\n\n\n\nPackages\nMany packages contain interesting datasets. If you can find a package with data, it will usually be nicely-formatted 😄\nHere is a table of lots of packages that contain multiple dataset. Some of my favorites are:\n\ndslabs\nDAAG\nMASS\n\nIn addition, some packages exclusively just contain datasets, such as:\n\nfivethirtyeight: Datasets and code published by the data journalism website ‘FiveThirtyEight’, available at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data\ngapminder\nbabynames\nnycflights13\nfueleconomy\nnasaweather\nusdanutrients\n\n\n\nGovernment-ish sources:\n“Government-ish” because while some of these sites host government data, the sites themselves may or may not be affiliated with a government agency:\n\nUS Open Gov Data: links to federal and non-federal sources in US and abroad\nUS City Open Data Census: Open data from more than 100 U.S. cities.\nOpen Africa\nEU Open Data Portal\nChina data: Various datasets on China posted by Gang He.\n\n\n\nEnergy data\nSince I happen to work with energy data a lot, here’s some common go-to sources:\n\nChina Energy Portal Statistics: Loads of energy statistics from China.\nU.S. Energy Information Administration: from Wikipedia: the “principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating energy information to promote sound policymaking, efficient markets, and public understanding of energy and its interaction with the economy and the environment. EIA programs cover data on coal, petroleum, natural gas, electric, renewable and nuclear energy. EIA is part of the U.S. Department of Energy.”\nEnvironmental Performance Index, Yale University: Ranks 163 countries on 25 performance indicators tracked across ten policy categories covering both environmental public health and ecosystem vitality. These indicators provide a gauge at a national government scale of how close countries are to established environmental policy goals.\n\n\n\nSpatial data\n\nhttp://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/\nhttps://data.nasa.gov/\nhttps://planet.parts/\nhttps://www.efi.int/knowledge/maps/forest\nhttps://land.copernicus.eu/\nhttps://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/\nhttps://www.ecad.eu//dailydata/predefinedseries.php\nhttp://www.worldclim.org/version2\nhttps://www.geoportal.org/\nhttps://scihub.copernicus.eu/\nhttps://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/\nhttps://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/"

    "text": "For your final project, you will take a dataset, explore it, tinker with it, and tell a nuanced story about it using at least three key charts. I want this project to be as useful for you and your future career as possible - you’ll hopefully want to show off your final project in a portfolio or during job interviews. Accordingly, you get to choose what data you will use for your project. Choose whatever one you are most interested in or will have the most fun with.\n\nCheck out these examples of other exploratory data analyses for inspiration\n\nFor the final project, you will:\n\nWrite a research question.\nConduct an exploratory data analysis of one or more data sources to address your research question.\nCreate visualizations to effectively communicate the results of your analysis using the principles of information visualization covered in this course.\nDocument your entire analysis in a reproducible format, including a detailed curation of the data you used as well as your analysis and results.\n\nPurpose: The skills covered in this course are rooted in design rules and principles rather than formulas and equations. As such, the application of these principles to a real data problem is one of the best ways to learn and assess mastery of these skills. I guarantee you one day you will need to apply these principles to communicate an idea to colleagues, so let’s make sure you have at least one chance to practice before the stakes are higher.\nSkills & Knowledge: Your final project should illustrate your ability to transform raw data into insights by making the non-visible visible, showing clear trends or patterns, and / or identifying outliers or missing information. The specific skills involved in achieving this goal include all of the course learning objectives.\nTeams: Your final project will be a team project made up of 2 to 3 classmates of your choosing. Teams will be finalized at the time of submitting your proposal. Graduate students taking the course must work on individual projects.\nSummary of Deliverables: To make the overall project more manageable, it is broken down into separate “milestone” deliverables due throughout the semester, starting with a proposal due just before spring break.\n\n\n\n\nItem\nWeight towardsfinal grade\nDue Date(by 11:59pm)\n\n\n\n\nProposal\n6 %\nSep 24\n\n\nProgress Report\n6 %\nOct 29\n\n\nFinal Report\n15 %\nDec 10\n\n\nPresentation\n6 %\nDec 12"

    "text": "This course provides students with a foundation in exploring data using the R programming language. Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using Quarto (which is built on the ideas of RMarkdown). Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\nThis course was inspired by many other courses / resources that cover similar material. In addition to my own developed material, I have also modified material from other courses and workshops - a full list of sources can be found in the LICENSE page.\nThis course was originally created by Dr. John Paul Helveston at the George Washington University for the Spring 2020 semester."

For example, you might expect the price of gasoline over a particular period to be rather tightly-grouped around a mean, whereas the stock price of a particular company might vary much more widely over the same period.\nDescribe two relationships you expect to find among variables in your data (again, regardless of whether they actually exist in your data). For example, you might expect sales of hybrid vehicles to increase when gas prices increase; in this case, I am expecting that hybrid vehicle sales and gasoline prices are positively correlated.\nDescribe at least two charts that you expect will help you visualize the relationships that you expect to find. For example, a scatterplot of gasoline prices and hybrid vehicle sales over a particular time period might be useful for visualizing the level of correlation between these two variables.\nDiscuss how your expectations about the variables you chose will help inform you about your research question."

This analysis uses some statistical modeling (which won’t cover), but the use of visualizations alone are effective for addressing the research questions posed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF1 racing data analysis\nby Jonathan Bouchet. This is an extensive exploratory data analysis of a variety of data on races, drivers, and constructors across the history of Formula 1 racing. This would probably be overkill for a course project, but sections of it (e.g. section 3 on the races, or sections 4 and 5 together on the drivers and constructors) would make a nice project. It involves mutliple data sets, some not-so-simple data cleaning, and a wide variety of nice visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing Intensity of Strong Atlantic Hurricanes\nby James B. Elsner. This is a short analysis with the goal of validating the predictions of this study published in Nature in 2008, which predicted that Atlantic tropical cyclones would continue to get stronger on average over time. While this analysis is too short to be considered adequate for a final project, it is still a good example of good data source documentation and one effective visualization. An expanded inquiry into the questions addressed here would make a good course project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath: Reality vs Reported\nby Owen Shen. This is an interesting original analysis in which the author collected the data himself. The analysis compares whether the proportion of actual causes of death is consistent with the proportion of death causes that the media reports. This analysis also uses some interactive graphics so that the reader can view different versions of the same plot, such as scrolling through the plot over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre first babies more likely to be late?\nby Allen Downey. This is another relatively short analysis, but the author does a good job of documenting his data sources, stating the assumptions he makes, and also describes what data were dropped from the analysis (i.e. babies born via C-section).\n\n\n\n\nHistorically significant analyses\nExploratory data analysis has been around for a very long time. Here are some of the most historically famous.\n\n\n\n\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois’ “The Exhibit of American Negroes”\nIn 1900, W.E.B. Du Bois presented “The Exhibit of American Negroes” at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. Du Bois described the exhibition as “Thirty-two charts, 500 photographs, and numerous maps and plans form the basis of this exhibit. The charts are in two sets, one illustrating conditions in the entire United States and the other conditions in the typical State of Georgia.” The charts in his exhibition are staggeringly powerful. This six-part series published in Nightingale displays and discusses many of his impressive visualizations.

The chart depicts Napoleon’s disastrous campaign to conquer Moscow. Having started with around 470,000 soldiers, he returned with just 10,000. The width of the line represents the total number of soldiers and the color represents the direction (yellow for towards Moscow, black for the return trip).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTableau’s Top 10 GOAT Data Visualizations\nIt’s hard to say which data visualizations are the “Greatest Of All Time,” but Tableau put together a pretty excellent collection for their top 10 list."

    "text": "EMSE 4572 / 6572Exploratory Data AnalysisFall 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides students with a foundation in exploring data using the R programming language. Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using Quarto (which is built on the ideas of RMarkdown). Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nWrite a clear, focused, concise, complex, and arguable research question.\nImport, manipulate, clean, visualize, and export data in R.\nWrangle data from its original format into a fit-for-purpose format.\nConduct a systematic exploratory data analysis (EDA) of different types of data.\nApply fundamental principles of visualizing information for exploratory analysis and communication.\nGet data off the web and expose data, code, results on the web.\nGenerate fully reproducible reports that contain code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\n\nPrerequisites:\nStudents should have taken EMSE 4571/6571: Intro to Programming for Analytics or have experience working with data in at least one programming language. If you’re not sure whether you have the necessary prerequisite skills, you can try and get up to speed by completing this optional course primer assignment before class starts. Once class starts, it may be difficult to keep up without this background, and it may be more beneficial to wait and take this course next year after taking Programming for Analytics."
