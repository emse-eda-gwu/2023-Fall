Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\n\n\n\nStudents should have taken EMSE 4571: Intro to Programming for Analytics or have experience working with data in at least one programming language. If you’re not sure whether you have the necessary prerequisite skills, you can try and get up to speed by completing this optional course primer assignment before class starts. Once class starts, it may be difficult to keep up without this background, and it may be more beneficial to wait and take this course next year after taking Programming for Analytics."

Hadley Wickham (chief data scientist at RStudio and author of many amazing R packages you’ll be using) made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions in Slack, and try it again later.\nI promise, you can do this!"

Quizzes will cover material presented in previous classes and assignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz.\nQuizzes are short (10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to demonstrate where additional study is needed. Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."

    "text": "Collaboration Policy\n\nLearning how to program is like learning how to ride a bicycle - to get better, you must practice writing code yourself. Therefore, we have a set of strict rules regarding what kind of collaboration is allowed, what counts as over-collaboration, and what counts as cheating.\n\nGood Collaboration\n\nDiscussing which general concepts might be useful in solving a problem (conditionals, loops, etc.).\nAsking for debugging help with code.\nSketch out algorithms on a whiteboard together.\nTo avoid copying the code, you should write up the solution together, discuss it, then erase the solution, wait a few minutes, and write up solutions individually.\nHelp each other debug specific parts of assignment code.\nGeneral discussion of course concepts.\nDetailed explanations of example code on the course website.\nCollaboratively solving a practice problem, with any level of co-writing code and co-debugging.\n\n\n\nOver-collaboration\nOver-collaboration results in a warning on the first offense, and a penalty on later offenses. Examples include:\n\nExplaining to a friend how to solve a problem in high-level terms by going through your own program line-by-line.\nHelping a friend debug code by suggesting they use your own approach to the problem.\nCollaborating with a student on an assignment and then not including their name as a collaborator in the assignment writeup.\nIn the case that you have taken this course before, copying your own code from the previous time you took the course.\n\n\n\nCheating\nCheating results in a penalty on the first offense, and failing the course on the second offense. Cheating on assignments can include:\n\nCopying or stealing any amount of code from someone currently in the class or someone who has taken the class before. Copying is never okay, whether the code is provided electronically, visually, audibly, or on paper.\nProviding code you have written for an assignment to anyone else in the class.\nFinding code online and using it in the assignment (one exception: you may use code from the course website).\nPutting code solutions from the course assignments online.\nReceiving code-level assistance from someone or something not associated with the course.\nGetting someone else to write the assignment code for you.\nAsking questions about the assignments on any online services outside of the course office hours or slack.\n\nCheating on quizzes, assignments, or the final project can include:\n\nReferring to any external resources while completing the assignment (phones, notes, etc.).\nCopying part of an answer off of another student’s paper, even if it is very small.\nUsing solutions provided by students who previously took the course.\n\n\n\nUse of chatGPT and other AI tools\nLarge language models (LLMs) are capable of producing exact solutions to some of the coding problems assigned in this class. So we all basically have a solutions manual available for free.\nWith this in mind, the use of AI tools is permitted as follows:\n\nAssignments 1-7: Not permitted. Copying solutions from these engines and submitting them as your own for these assignments will be considered cheating. In this section of the course, we are building foundational skills in computational thinking and problem solving. If you don’t master these skills, you won’t be able to interpret what chatGPT is giving you, and you won’t be able to test if it is wrong. Master these skills first - it is worth the effort.\nAssignments 8-13: Permitted, with caveats. If you do use AI tools on these assignments, you must include the prompt(s) you used as well as changed to made to them to get better results to receive full credit.\n\nLearn to use tools like ChatGPT as a learning assistant - a tool to help you accomplish the task - rather than just a solutions manual. One version of using it makes you a better and more efficient coder, the other robs you of that.\nIn the follow-on course to this one (EMSE 4572: Exploratory Data Analysis), the use of AI engines will be allowed to support your projects.\n\n\nPenalties\nViolations will be reported to the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities. Penalties are decided by the course instructors, and can vary based on the severity of the offense. Possible penalties include:\n\nReceiving a 0 on the assignment/quiz in question.\nReceiving a full letter grade deduction in the course.\nAutomatically failing the course.\n\nDepending on the student’s prior academic history, violations may also be accompanied by a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs, again at the instructors’ discretion. This can lead to university-level penalties, such as being suspended or expelled.\n\n\nPlagiarism Detection\nPrograms are naturally structured, which makes them very easy to compare for plagiarism. Automated plagiarism detection systems make this process even easier. Watch this video showing plagiarism detection software in action (this example is using Python code, but this also works for R code).\nIn short, if you copy code, we will know - don’t copy code!\n\n\nGrace Period\nCollege is a time when you do a lot of learning. Sometimes, you might make bad decisions or mistakes. The most important thing for you to do is to learn from your mistakes, to constantly grow, and become a better person.\nSometimes, students panic and copy code right before the deadline, then regret what they did afterwards. Therefore, you may rescind any homework submission for up to 24 hours after the deadline with no questions asked. Simply email the course instructors asking to delete the submission in question, and we will do so. Deleted submissions will not be considered during plagiarism detection, though of course they will also not be graded. However, it will always be better to get a 0 (or partial credit) on an assignment than to get a cheating violation!"

    "text": "EMSE 4572 / 6572Exploratory Data AnalysisFall 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides students with a foundation in exploring data using the R programming language. Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nWrite a clear, focused, concise, complex, and arguable research question.\nImport, manipulate, clean, visualize, and export data in R.\nWrangle data from its original format into a fit-for-purpose format.\nConduct a systematic exploratory data analysis (EDA) of different types of data.\nApply fundamental principles of visualizing information for exploratory analysis and communication.\nGet data off the web and expose data, code, results on the web.\nGenerate fully reproducible reports that contain code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\n\nPrerequisites:\nStudents should have taken EMSE 4571: Intro to Programming for Analytics or have experience working with data in at least one programming language. If you’re not sure whether you have the necessary prerequisite skills, you can try and get up to speed by completing this optional course primer assignment before class starts. Once class starts, it may be difficult to keep up without this background, and it may be more beneficial to wait and take this course next year after taking Programming for Analytics."
